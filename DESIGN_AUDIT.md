# Design Audit: Content Models

This document provides an audit of the Strapi content models for the New World Kids project. The audit focuses on naming conventions, component usage, content relationships, and overall developer experience.

## 1. Naming Conventions

### Findings:

*   **Overall Consistency:** Naming is generally consistent and clear. `displayName` values are in PascalCase (e.g., `FooterItem`, `Page`), and collection names are plural and kebab-cased or snake_cased where appropriate (e.g., `footers`, `internal_jobs`).
*   **Attribute Casing:** Attribute names are consistently in camelCase (e.g., `copyRight`, `logoImage`). This is a good practice.
*   **Inconsistent `displayName` Casing:** There are some inconsistencies in the casing of `displayName` for SEO components: `metaSocial` and `seo`. It would be better to use PascalCase for all `displayName` values for consistency (e.g., `MetaSocial`, `Seo`).
*   **Clarity:** Most names are clear and descriptive.

### Recommendations:

*   **Recommendation 1.1 (Minor):** Update the `displayName` of the `metaSocial` and `seo` components to `MetaSocial` and `Seo` respectively, to maintain a consistent PascalCase convention across all components.

## 2. Component Usage

### Findings:

*   **Good Componentization:** The project makes excellent use of components for reusable elements like `Link`, `BasicImage`, and `ImageWithLink`. This is a major strength of the content model design.
*   **Well-Organized Components:** Components are logically grouped into categories (`elements`, `forms`, `sections`, `seo-utilities`, `utilities`), which makes them easy to find and manage.
*   **Dynamic Zones:** The `Page` content type effectively uses a dynamic zone (`content`) to allow for flexible page layouts. This is a powerful feature of Strapi that has been well-implemented here.

### Recommendations:

*   **No major recommendations.** The component usage is already very good. Continue to follow this pattern as the project grows.

## 3. Content Relationships

### Findings:

*   **Parent-Child Pages:** The `Page` content type has a self-referencing `parent`/`children` relationship, which is great for creating hierarchical page structures.
*   **Redirects:** The `Redirect` content type is correctly linked to the `Page` content type, allowing for easy management of URL redirects.
*   **Relationships are Logical:** All other relationships seem logical and well-defined.

### Recommendations:

*   **No major recommendations.** The content relationships are well-structured.

## 4. Developer Experience

### Findings:

*   **Intuitive Structure:** The content model is generally intuitive and easy to understand. A front-end developer should be able to quickly grasp the structure and start building queries.
*   **Localization:** The use of `i18n` for localization is a great feature, but it's applied inconsistently. Some fields that a content editor might want to translate are not localizable (e.g., `merchant.zip`, `merchant.category`).
*   **Required Fields:** The use of `required` fields is good, but could be more extensive. For example, in the `Link` component, `url` is not required. This could lead to links that have a `title` but no destination.
*   **Enumerations:** The use of `enumeration` types is good for fields like `Track.bin` and `Promo.kind`. However, the values are hard-coded in the schema. For longer lists or lists that might change, using a separate collection type and a relation might be more maintainable.

### Recommendations:

*   **Recommendation 4.1 (Medium):** Review all fields and ensure that localization (`"localized": true`) is enabled for any field that might need to be translated. This is especially important for user-facing content.
*   **Recommendation 4.2 (Medium):** Make the `url` field in the `utilities.link` component required (`"required": true`) to prevent content editors from creating links without a destination.
*   **Recommendation 4.3 (Low):** For enumerations with many options or options that might change frequently, consider creating a separate collection type and using a relation instead. This is not a critical issue, but it could improve long-term maintainability.

## Summary

Overall, the content model for the New World Kids project is well-designed. It makes good use of Strapi's features, is generally consistent, and provides a good developer experience. The recommendations in this audit are mostly minor to medium-level improvements that would enhance consistency and maintainability.
