## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** - For PostgreSQL database
- **Node.js 22** - Runtime environment
- **Yarn 1.22** - Package manager
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Recommended for Node version management

### Quick Start (5 steps)

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/executiveusa/strapi-template-v1.git trail-mixx
   cd trail-mixx
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   # Switch to Node 22
   nvm use

   # Install all workspace dependencies
   yarn
   ```

3. **Configure environment**

   ```sh
   # Copy example env files (auto-copied by postinstall)
   cp .env.example .env
   cp services/cms/.env.example services/cms/.env
   cp services/stream/.env.example services/stream/.env
   cp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local
   ```

4. **Start the database**

   ```sh
   cd services/cms
   docker compose up -d db
   cd ../..
   ```

5. **Run all services**

   > [!TIP]
   > Before first run, retrieve a [Strapi API token](https://docs.strapi.io/cms/features/api-tokens) after starting Strapi.
   
   **Terminal 1 - CMS:**
   ```sh
   yarn dev:cms
   ```
   Go to <http://localhost:1337/admin> and create an admin user. Then create a **Read-Only API Token** from Settings ‚Üí API Tokens.

   **Terminal 2 - Stream Service:**
   ```sh
   yarn dev:stream
   ```

   **Terminal 3 - Web App:**
   ```sh
   # First, add the API token to apps/web/.env.local
   # STRAPI_REST_READONLY_API_KEY=your-token-here
   yarn dev:web
   ```

   **Or run all at once:**
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   **Access the apps:**
   - üéµ **Player:** <http://localhost:3000/en/listen>
   - üéõÔ∏è **CMS Admin:** <http://localhost:1337/admin>
   - üìä **Stream Metrics:** <http://localhost:3001/metrics>
   - üè† **Website:** <http://localhost:3000/>

### Seed Sample Data

After starting the CMS, populate it with sample content:

```sh
# Make sure CMS is running first
node services/cms/scripts/seed/seed-data.js
```

This creates sample:
- Promos (nonprofit, BIPOC, event)
- Merchants (local businesses)
- Shows (radio programs)
- Tracks (music library)

### Next Steps

1. **Configure HLS:** Update `HLS_ORIGIN` in `services/stream/.env` with your stream URL
2. **Customize branding:** See [DESIGN_AUDIT.md](./DESIGN_AUDIT.md) for theme customization
3. **Review compliance:** Read [docs/compliance/README.md](./docs/compliance/README.md) before going live
4. **Build mobile apps:** Follow [apps/mobile/README.md](./apps/mobile/README.md) for iOS/Android builds

## ‚òï Turborepo scripts

After installing dependencies and setting env vars up, you can control all apps using Turbo CLI. Some common commands are wrapped into `yarn` scripts. You can find them in root [package.json](./package.json) file. For example:

```bash
# run all apps in dev mode (this triggers `yarn dev` script in each app from `/apps` directory)
yarn dev

# build all apps
yarn build

# dev run of specific app(s)
yarn dev:ui
yarn dev:strapi
```

## üîå VSCode Extensions

Install extensions listed in the [.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) file and have a better development experience.

## üî± Husky tasks

Husky is installed by default and configured to run following tasks:

1. `lint` (eslint) and `format` (prettier) on every commit (`pre-commit` hook). To do that, [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) library is used. This is a fast failsafe to ensure code doesn't get committed if it fails linting rules and that when it does get committed, it is consistently formatted. Running linters only on staged files (those that have been added to Git index using `git add`) is much faster than processing all files in the working directory. The `format` task is configured in root `.lintstagedrc.js` and run globally for whole monorepo. The `lint` task is configured in each app individually and Strapi is skipped by default.

2. `commitlint` on every commit message (`commit-msg` hook). It checks if commit messages meet [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

## üìø Scripts

### Package.json

- `yarn commit` - interactive commit message generator üî•. How? Stage files you want to commit (e.g. using VS Code Source Control) and then run this script in the terminal from root and fill in the required information.
- `yarn format` - format code using prettier in whole monorepo. Prettier formats `package.json` files too.

### Utils

- `bash ./scripts/utils/rm-modules.sh` - Remove all `node_modules` folders in the monorepo. Useful for scratch dependencies installation.
- `bash ./scripts/utils/rm-all.sh` - Remove all `node_modules`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `.strapi`, `dist` folders.

## ‚ôæÔ∏è CI/CD

### GitHub Actions

We are using `GitHub Actions` for continuous integration. The `CI` expects some variables (`APP_PUBLIC_URL`, `STRAPI_URL` and `STRAPI_REST_READONLY_API_KEY`) to be available on the runner, so make sure to add them in the repository's settings. Have a look at the [workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) definition for more details.

### Heroku

- `./scripts/heroku/heroku-postbuild.sh` - Script for Heroku deployment to decide which app to build. It can be removed if not deploying to Heroku.

## üíô Feedback

This repository was created based on [strapi-next-monorepo-starter](https://github.com/notum-cz/strapi-next-monorepo-starter). If you encounter a problem with the template code during development, or you have implemented a useful feature that should be part of that template, please create an issue with a description or PR in that repository. So we can keep it updated with great features.
