# New World Kids Platform

Welcome to the official repository for the New World Kids educational platform. Our mission is to move young people from "survival mode" to a state of purpose and dignity by providing them with the skills and tools to build a better future.

## âœ¨ A New Way of Building: The MCP-Augmented Workflow

This project is built and maintained using a state-of-the-art, AI-augmented development process. We leverage a suite of nine integrated  (MCP) servers** to automate, validate, and accelerate our work. This is not just a codebase; it's an intelligent, self-improving development ecosystem.



### Our Integrated MCP Suite

Our workflow is powered by the following specialized AI assistants:

| Phase     | MCP Server      | Purpose                                     |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| ****   | **Linear**      | The System of Record for all tasks.         |
|           | **GitHub**      | Automates repository and PR management.     |
|           | **Perplexity**  | Our Research Partner for best practices.    |
| *** |       **Semgrep**     | Our automated Security Analyst.             |
|           | **Playwright**  | Validates UI changes and prevents regressions.|
| **** |      **Firebase**    | A secure co-pilot for backend operations.   |
|           | **Context7**    | Provides always-up-to-date documentation.   |
| ****|       **Vibe Check**  | Our Architectural Conscience.               |
|           | **Pieces**      | Our collective Long-Term Memory.            |
