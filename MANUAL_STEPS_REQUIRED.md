## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANUAL STEPS NEEDED (3 Tasks)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations (CRITICAL) ‚è±Ô∏è 3 minutes

**Why manual:** Supabase CLI not available on Windows, REST API doesn't support direct SQL execution

**What to do:**

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor:**
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sbbuxnyvflczfzvsglpe/sql/new

2. **Run Migration 1 - Initial Schema:**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/20250120_initial_schema.sql`
   - Copy ALL contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click **"RUN"** button
   - Wait for success message (should take ~5 seconds)

3. **Run Migration 2 - Impact Tracking:**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/20250120_impact_tracking.sql`
   - Copy ALL contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click **"RUN"** button
   - Wait for success message (should take ~3 seconds)

4. **Verify migrations worked:**
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents;            -- Should return 6
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM impact_projects;   -- Should return 5
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM partnerships;      -- Should return 5
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_posts;        -- Should return 5
   ```

**Expected output:**
- agents: 6 rows (Sirius, Andromeda, Vega, Rigel, Cassiopeia, Betelgeuse)
- impact_projects: 5 rows (Seattle-focused projects)
- partnerships: 5 rows (AI2, Microsoft, Code.org, UW, Seattle Foundation)
- blog_posts: 5 rows (AI/nonprofit/agritech news)

### Step 2: Add SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION to Vercel ‚è±Ô∏è 1 minute

**Why manual:** Vercel API network error during CLI execution

**What to do:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   https://vercel.com/jeremy-bowers-s-projects/strapi-template-new-world-kids/settings/environment-variables

2. **Click "Add New" button**

3. **Fill in:**
   - **Key:** `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION`
   - **Value:** `1`
   - **Environments:** Check all three: Production, Preview, Development

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "..." menu on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait for build to complete (~2 minutes)

**Why this is needed:** Next.js build validates environment variables, but we're using Vercel's encrypted vars which aren't available at build time.

---

### Step 3: Add Your AI API Keys ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes

**Why manual:** API keys are personal and shouldn't be committed to git

**What to do:**

1. **Get OpenAI API Key:**
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`)
   - Save it somewhere safe

2. **Get Anthropic API Key:**
   - Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
   - Click "Create Key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)
   - Save it somewhere safe

3. **Get Google AI API Key:**
   - Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `AIza`)
   - Save it somewhere safe

4. **Update `.env.local`:**
   - Open file: `.env.local` in project root
   - Replace these lines:
     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-ai-key-here
     ```
   - Paste your actual keys
   - Save the file

**Note:** All 3 keys are required for agents to work. OpenAI and Anthropic have free trials, Google AI has a generous free tier.

## üöÄ READY TO DEPLOY (After Manual Steps)

Once you've completed the 3 manual steps above, you're ready to deploy!

### Option A: Local Docker Deployment (Recommended for Testing)

```bash
# Start all 4 backend services
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 30 seconds for services to start

# Verify everything is healthy
node verify-deployment.js local

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop when done
docker-compose down
```

**Services will run at:**
- Stellar Agents: http://localhost:3004
- Big-3 Orchestrator: http://localhost:3010
- Browser Service: http://localhost:3013
- Chrome DevTools MCP: http://localhost:3014

**Frontend (separately):**
```bash
cd apps/web
yarn dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/impact
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/cockpit
```

---

### Option B: Railway Production Deployment

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy all services (automated)
./deploy.sh railway

# Or deploy manually
cd services/stellar-agents && railway up
cd ../big-3-orchestrator && railway up
cd ../browser-service && railway up
cd ../chrome-devtools-mcp && railway up

# Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
# (See ENV_SETUP.md for details)

# Verify production deployment
node verify-deployment.js production
```

## ‚ùì Need Help?

### Database Migrations Not Working?
- Check that you copied the ENTIRE SQL file
- Make sure you clicked "RUN" in Supabase editor
- If you see "already exists" errors, that's OK - tables are created
- Verify with: `SELECT * FROM agents;`

### Vercel Build Still Failing?
- Check that `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` is set for ALL environments
- Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` exists
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check build logs for specific errors

### Docker Services Not Starting?
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Check that you updated `.env.local` with API keys
- Run: `docker-compose logs [service-name]` to see errors
- Common issue: Missing API keys (services will crash without them)

### API Keys Not Working?
- OpenAI: Make sure you have billing enabled (free trial requires credit card)
- Anthropic: Accept terms of service in console
- Google AI: Check API is enabled for your project
