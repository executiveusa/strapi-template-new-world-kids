## Known Limitations

### v1.0.0 Constraints
- No volume control UI (uses device volume)
- No playlist/queue support
- No offline caching
- No Chromecast/AirPlay
- Spanish translations need native review

### Expected Behavior
- Stream service requires HLS_ORIGIN configuration
- Player needs NEXT_PUBLIC_HLS_URL set
- Mobile apps require native IDE setup
- Seed script must be run manually

## How to Verify

### Local Testing
```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone [repo]
cd trail-mixx
yarn

# 2. Start database
cd services/cms
docker compose up -d db

# 3. Run all services
yarn dev

# 4. Seed data
node services/cms/scripts/seed/seed-data.js

# 5. Test player
# Visit http://localhost:3000/en/listen
# Click play button
# Verify audio loads (or fallback activated)
```

### Build Verification
```bash
# Build all services
yarn build

# Should complete without errors
# - apps/web builds Next.js
# - services/cms builds Strapi
# - services/stream compiles TypeScript
```

### Documentation Review
```bash
# View all documentation
ls -R docs/

# Key files to review:
# - README.md - Main documentation
# - DESIGN_AUDIT.md - Design system
# - MIGRATION_NOTES.md - Migration guide
# - CHANGELOG.md - Version history
# - docs/compliance/ - Legal requirements
# - docs/spec-kit/ - Acceptance criteria
```
