UI/UX Design Review and Recommendations
Design Audit Summary (Steve Krug’s Heuristics)
Intuitive & Self-Explanatory Design: The portfolio’s interface should require minimal cognitive effort
to navigate. Currently, users may need to think too much about how to view projects or navigate the
site. According to Krug’s first law, the UI must be self-explanatory and clear. We recommend
simplifying labels, buttons, and icons so their purpose is immediately obvious (e.g. clear “View
Project” calls-to-action on cards). Use familiar icons (like a magnifier for view, an X for close) and
make interactive elements visually distinct (buttons, hover highlights). This reduces cognitive
load and aligns with the “Don’t Make Me Think” principle.
Scannable Content & Visual Hierarchy: Users scan pages rather than read every word , so the
layout must highlight key info. Currently, project titles or section headings might not stand out
enough. Design each page like a billboard – with a clear, concise message or title prominently visible
within seconds. Use a strong visual hierarchy: for example, make the portfolio owner’s name or
page title immediately visible in the hero, use large project titles, and supportive subtitles. Ensure
font sizes and weights guide the eye (large/bold for titles, medium for subtitles, regular for
descriptions). Avoid clutter around key content; generous whitespace and concise text will help
users find relevant info quickly.
Simplified Choices & Navigation: The user flow should offer mindless, straightforward choices
. Currently, if projects open in new pages or external sites, it might disorient users or lead to
premature exits. Instead, adopt a modal-first approach : clicking a project card opens a focused
modal overlay with project details, rather than a separate page. This keeps users in context and
prevents them from leaving unintentionally. Provide a single prominent action in the modal (“Open
Project Site”) for those who want to dive deeper. By reducing the steps (one click to open modal, one
more to visit external link if desired) and keeping the back action simple (close modal to return), we
minimize required decisions and clicks. Also ensure the navigation (if any menu or links) is
consistent and visible – e.g., a sticky menu icon or clearly labeled sections – so users always know
how to get around without confusion.

Omit Needless Elements: In line with Krug’s guidance, remove or refine any unnecessary text or
design elements. Each project card, for instance, should display only the essential information
(project name, a short one-liner or category, and maybe an indicative image). Avoid long
descriptions on the main grid – detailed info can live inside the modal. Likewise, trim instructional
text; for example, instead of a banner saying “Click on a card to view details”, make the cards
themselves clearly clickable with hover effects, thereby showing affordance instead of telling.
Simplicity and clarity in content will improve user focus. Every label and piece of text on the site
should be purposeful and concise, supporting quick understanding.

Color Scheme & Psychology
The current color palette should be evaluated for the emotions it evokes and its contrast effectiveness.
Colors significantly influence user perceptions – studies show 84% of users cite color scheme as a key
factor in their decisions or interest. Ensure the chosen colors align with the portfolio’s desired impression
(e.g. a creative tech portfolio might use an energetic accent color, whereas a design studio might use a
sophisticated or calming palette). For example, using a bold accent (like a vibrant blue or neon green) for
interactive elements can signal creativity and action, while a dark background can convey sophistication or
a modern tech feel – as seen on GSAP’s award-winning site which uses neon green on black to convey
energy. However, balance is key: use a neutral or dark backdrop with high contrast text for readability,
and one or two accent colors for consistency. Each color should have a role (primary action, background,
hover state, etc.), and these should remain consistent to reduce cognitive load. Leverage color psychology
carefully by considering associations (e.g. blue for trust , green for growth/freshness , red for excitement
) but always ensure adequate contrast (meeting WCAG AA standards for text). The portfolio’s color
scheme should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also guide attention – for instance, a consistent accent
color on all clickable buttons and links tells users “this color means action.”

Inspiration from Awwwards References
We draw design inspiration from top-tier awwwards sites provided in the references to elevate the aesthetic
and UX:

Immersive Full-Page Hero: A signature full-page hero section should greet users on every page,
establishing a strong first impression. For example, the Yogamaya site’s redesign is described as
“immersive and informative, like the studio itself” – meaning the visuals and layout immediately
convey the site’s purpose and vibe. Following this, we recommend a fullscreen hero on the portfolio
with striking imagery or a subtle animation that reflects your personal brand. The hero should
persist as a recognizable element across pages (more on this in Hero Section Integration below). This
aligns with best-in-class designs: Yogamaya uses a clean, fullscreen single-page layout with
engaging transitions and even unconventional navigation to keep the experience lively. Similarly,
Alejandro Schintu’s portfolio blends storytelling with performance, using large background visuals
and micro-interactions to captivate viewers. We should aim for a balance of creativity and
clarity – e.g., a hero with an interactive 3D graphic (Spline) or looping video that doesn’t distract from
the headline text. The hero must also include a clear title or tagline that tells visitors what this site is
(e.g. “Jeremy Bowers – Projects & Portfolio”) within seconds of landing.
GSAP-Level Interactivity: Modern interactive touches can set the portfolio apart. The GSAP site
(awwwards SOTD) demonstrates “super fun hero animations” and smooth scrolling effects to engage
users immediately. We can incorporate subtle animations: for instance, project cards can have
hover effects (slight zoom or content reveal), scroll-triggered reveal animations for sections, and a
polished modal opening transition (fading or sliding down). These should be tasteful and not
overwhelming – the goal is to add a sense of sophistication and delight (as seen on high-end sites)
without hampering usability. Micro-interactions (small hover responses, button press effects) provide
feedback and make the interface feel responsive and alive. All animation should be performant
(leveraging CSS transforms or lightweight GSAP/Framer Motion for more complex sequences) and
should degrade gracefully on mobile (where reduced motion might be preferred).

Consistent Visual Style (Awwwards Aesthetic): Across the site, maintain a cohesive, modern
aesthetic inspired by award-winning designs. This includes bold typography , ample whitespace, and
thoughtful use of imagery. For instance, top portfolios often use large sans-serif headings paired
with minimalist layouts to let content breathe. We recommend using a consistent type scale and
perhaps an elegant font pairing (one for headings, one for body) that echoes the style seen on
awwwards sites (many use clean geometric sans-serifs or stylish serifs for character). Ensure the
visual hierarchy is beautiful: maybe the project cards each feature a cover image with an overlay
and a sleek text treatment, similar to an “elements gallery” inspiration from awwwards. The
color palette should also be consistent site-wide – for example, Yogamaya sticks to two main colors
(warm beige and dark teal) for coherence. Choose your brand colors and apply them uniformly
for backgrounds, text, accents, and interactive states. Finally, transitions between states (hover,
modal open/close, page scroll) should be smooth (around 200–300ms ease animations) to mirror the
polished feel of sites like Yogamaya and others.
Recommended UI/UX Improvements (Design Upgrades & Rationale)
Below is a detailed list of necessary design and layout upgrades, with rationale for each improvement:

Redesign Project Cards for Clarity & Impact: The project cards should be visually striking and
immediately communicate each project at a glance. We suggest converting the current cards into
image-driven cards with an overlay: a high-quality screenshot or thumbnail fills the card, overlaid
by the project title and a brief subtitle/category. This mirrors the awwwards “gallery” style that
engages users with visuals first. On hover (or tap on mobile), the card can subtly elevate or
reveal additional info (e.g. a short description or a “View More” icon) – providing an affordance that
it’s clickable. Use Tailwind utility classes to implement a smooth hover transition (transition-
transform duration-300 ease-out, etc.). The improved design will grab attention via imagery
and clear titles, aligning with Krug’s advice that important info should be prominent and easily found
. By reducing textual clutter on the card (just a concise title and maybe one line of context), we
let users scan the projects quickly and decide where to click. The rationale is that a visual card
both appeals emotionally (users get a sneak peek of the project) and reduces effort in understanding
what the project is about.

Implement Modal-Only Project Details: Replace any separate project detail pages with modal
overlays. When a user clicks a project card, load a modal that contains the project’s detailed
information (extended description, technologies, big screenshot carousel, etc.) on top of the project
list page. This keeps the user in one context – they don’t lose the scroll position or the surrounding
context of the portfolio. It also follows a consistent interaction logic: every project is explored in the
same way (click -> modal) rather than a mix of new tabs or internal pages. This modal-first logic
prevents accidental page exits and aligns with a “don’t make me think” approach by providing a
straightforward, reversible action (open modal, close modal) instead of a potentially confusing
navigation. For SEO and shareability, each modal can correspond to a unique URL (e.g. /
projects/project-name) using Next.js routing, but when opened from the main page it behaves
as a modal (we will use Next.js 13+ routing techniques to intercept routes and render modals).
Ensure the modal has an obvious close button (top-right “×”) and clicking the dimmed background or
pressing Esc also closes it – adhering to usability best practices. Inside the modal, include an “Open
Project” button that either opens the live project site in a new tab (recommended to avoid losing the
portfolio) or navigates to a full project page if needed. This two-step approach (modal preview then

explicit open) provides the user a quick preview without commitment, reducing pogo-sticking and
keeping the overall experience smooth.
Enhanced Layout Structure & Responsiveness: Refine the site’s layout for mobile, tablet,
desktop, and large screens , ensuring a responsive, fluid experience at all breakpoints. Start mobile-
first: on small screens (iOS/Android), use a single-column layout for project cards (stacked vertically)
or a horizontal scroll gallery if that better showcases visuals. All touch targets (cards, buttons) should
be at least ~44px in height to meet mobile accessibility. The design must account for notched devices
include CSS safe-area insets if necessary so content isn’t cut off on iPhone (e.g. padding at top/
bottom where needed). On tablets, switch to a two-column grid of cards with appropriate gutters.
On desktop, a masonry or uniform grid of three columns works well for a portfolio; use Tailwind’s
grid classes (e.g. grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6) so that at lg
breakpoint and above, users see three projects in a row. The hero section on mobile could condense
to fit the smaller screen (e.g. maybe hide non-essential decorative elements, ensure text is readable
on small screens by using responsive text sizes). Every breakpoint should be tested : the hero text
should never overflow or become too small, and modals on mobile should occupy the full screen
(with perhaps a slightly different styling – e.g. slide up from bottom, since that feels natural on
mobile). By respecting each breakpoint’s needs, we guarantee the site looks and works great on all
devices. The outcome is a cohesive experience, where nothing feels “squeezed in” or broken. Users
on any device will find the interface natural – a critical factor since mobile web usage is high.
Full-Page Hero Section Integration: Establish a persistent full-page hero as a signature style
across the site. The hero should serve as a dynamic backdrop or header that reinforces your brand/
design aesthetic. For example, it might be a fixed background element with subtle animation (using
Spline’s 3D canvas or a looping video) that is visible on the homepage and still subtly present when a
modal is open or when scrolling. We must ensure this hero does not conflict with the Spline
animation – practically, this means layering the hero and Spline correctly: the Spline 3D object can
be integrated within the hero section or as a background layer. Use z-index to keep interactive UI
elements (navigation, cards, modals) above the Spline canvas, and possibly pause or simplify the
animation when a modal opens to reduce distraction. The hero content (text/logo) should also
remain accessible: for instance, Alejandroschintu’s site uses large background visuals but keeps text
legible by overlaying color gradients or high-contrast text. We can apply similar techniques (like a
dark overlay behind hero text or blur effect on the Spline background when scrolling) to maintain
readability. Persisting the hero on every page (including project detail modals) can be achieved by
placing it in a Next.js layout component that wraps all pages. This way, navigating or opening
modals doesn’t re-render or remove the hero; it might just dim or animate subtly in the background.
This approach, seen in sites like Yogamaya and Alejandro Schintu , creates continuity and a strong
brand identity – the user is always aware of the site’s overarching theme, providing a memorable
experience. Best practices from similar sites show that a fullscreen hero with interactive elements
can dramatically increase engagement if done right , so long as performance is optimized (lazy-
load heavy assets, use requestAnimationFrame for animations, etc.).
Consistent Interaction & Navigation Logic: Unify how interactive elements behave throughout the
site. Every button, link, or card should follow a consistent style and response so users aren’t
surprised. For instance, hover and active states should be uniform (all buttons perhaps lighten or
elevate on hover, all links maybe underline or change color on hover). Use Tailwind to apply these
states globally (e.g. define a utility or use component classes). Navigation elements (like a
3.

13

hamburger menu or section links) should appear in the same place and style on each page (consider
a sticky top nav icon, or a slide-out menu that covers the hero if needed). If using an unusual
navigation (as inspired by Yogamaya’s “unusual navigation” tag ), ensure it remains intuitive: for
example, if sections scroll horizontally or a custom cursor is used, provide visual cues or instructions
in a subtle way. Interaction logic consistency also means things like the modal behavior should be
the same for each project (e.g. clicking background always closes it, the close [X] is in a predictable
corner). By maintaining consistency, we leverage user learned behavior – once they open one
project, they’ll know how all others work, eliminating guesswork. This directly ties to Krug’s principle
of not making users figure things out repeatedly. Also, ensure external links (like an “Open
Project” or social links) are clearly indicated (perhaps with an external link icon and opening in new
tabs with rel="noopener"). Consistency extends to animations too: if we use a fade-in for content
on one page, use similar transition patterns on others for a coherent feel. Overall, a user should feel
the site is one unified product with a clear logic, rather than a collection of disparate pieces.
Improved Visual Hierarchy & Typography: Revisit typography and spacing to establish a clear
visual hierarchy. Make sure the project titles (on cards and in modals) are prominent – they should
likely be one of the largest text elements, as they are key info. Use a consistent heading style for all
project titles. Supporting text (like project type, date, or a short description) should be visibly
subordinate (smaller size or lighter color). We recommend using 2-3 font sizes in a card: e.g. title
large, subtitle small, and nothing more. Additionally, ensure adequate contrast between text and
background (use Tailwind classes like text-white on dark overlays, etc., and consider semi-
transparent overlays on images to keep text readable). The visual hierarchy must guide the eye in
the correct order: Hero title first, then section title (“Projects”), then individual project titles, etc.,
without competition. This aligns with Krug’s advice that font size, color, and contrast help
differentiate importance. Also, enforce consistent spacing: equal padding inside cards, uniform
margin between grid items, and logical spacing between sections (e.g. more space above a section
title than between items within the section). A consistent 8px or 4px baseline grid can be used with
Tailwind’s spacing scale to maintain rhythm. These typographic and layout tweaks will make the site
look polished and professional (an awwwards-like quality) and reduce the effort for users to parse
content. When the hierarchy is clear, users can instantly find the project name, then optionally read
the smaller details – matching how people scan pages.
Color and Contrast Enhancements: Fine-tune the color usage for both aesthetics and function.
Choose a primary brand color and an accent that will be used for interactive elements (buttons,
links, hover states). Ensure this color is used consistently to create a familiar pattern (e.g. if the
accent is orange, all clickable highlights and icons use that shade). Check contrast: if the hero uses a
vibrant background, overlay a translucent dark layer under text or use lighter text to ensure
readability. Utilize color psychology to support content – for example, if you want to convey
creativity and energy, a pop of a warm color (like a bright coral or yellow) on hover can subliminally
add excitement, whereas a cooler blue might convey trustworthiness for your portfolio. Keep in
mind that colors trigger emotions and associations , but they must also align with personal
branding. If the current palette feels off (e.g. too many clashing colors or a color that doesn't match
the content’s mood), consider a refresh inspired by the references: Yogamaya’s palette (#ebdcc
beige and #0b2a2b dark teal) creates a calm, modern feel for a yoga studio – in a tech portfolio
context, one might choose a dark charcoal background and one vivid neon or pastel accent for a
sleek yet creative vibe (similar to GSAP’s neon green on black for a techy excitement ).
Additionally, implement a dark/light mode toggle if possible: many modern sites offer this, and it

enhances user comfort. If implementing, ensure the design in both modes remains consistent in
quality (this is optional but a nice touch for an awwwards-level site). Lastly, verify all text meets
accessibility contrast ratios; use Tailwind classes like bg-gray-800 text-gray-100 for dark
sections, etc., to guarantee readability.
Responsive Media and Performance: Optimize images and media for fast loading and adaptability.
Each project card likely features a screenshot – use Next.js’s built-in Image component for efficient
loading (with next/image you get automatic resizing and formats). Provide a placeholder for
each image (blur-up or a solid color) so that even while loading, the card has a visual placeholder.
This avoids layout jank and gives the impression of speed. Also, implement layout skeletons for
content that loads asynchronously: for example, if project details are fetched on modal open, show a
skeleton modal state (with grey blocks for image and text) while waiting. This approach is supported
by UX research: users perceive interfaces as faster and more reliable when skeletons or spinners
indicate progress, rather than staring at nothing. Tailwind can be used to create skeleton styles (e.g.
animate-pulse bg-gray-700 elements for placeholders). Make sure media queries are used to
maybe load smaller images on mobile to save bandwidth. Given Alejandro Schintu’s portfolio touts
an LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) of 1.3s , performance is part of the awwwards aesthetic too.
Thus, audit the site for any heavy scripts or unoptimized assets (like huge images) and address
those. Use modern techniques: compress images, use prefetch for modal content if possible, and
perhaps code-split the modal component so it’s not loaded until needed. The result will be a snappy
experience where design enhancements don’t compromise load times – crucial for both user
experience and SEO.
Accessibility Improvements: As we refine the design, we must also ensure it’s accessible to all
users. This includes proper aria labels and roles for interactive components. For example, the
modal container should have role="dialog" and aria-modal="true", and the modal’s close
button should be an actual <button> with aria-label="Close modal" so screen readers
announce it. All images (especially project screenshots) need meaningful alt text describing the
project or image content (or use empty alt if purely decorative). Ensure keyboard navigation works:
users should be able to tab through project cards and open the modal via keyboard (thus each card
should be an accessible link or button). When the modal opens, trap focus inside it (so Tab key loops
within the modal controls) and return focus to the triggering element when closed – many libraries
or a bit of JS can handle this. Also, design with sufficient color contrast (as noted) and avoid using
color alone to signify meaning (e.g. an error message should not rely solely on red color without an
icon or text indicating error). If any animations are intense, provide a prefers-reduced-motion
fallback (CSS @media (prefers-reduced-motion) to disable or simplify certain motions for
those who opt out). By addressing these, the site will not only be compliant with standards but also
provide a frictionless experience to a wider audience , in line with the principle of not making
users (of all abilities) think too hard or struggle with the interface.
Design for Deployment & Portability: Lastly, structure the project’s frontend code and assets in a
way that’s easy to containerize and deploy across various services (Railway, Vercel, Hostinger, Coolify,
GCP, etc.). This is more of a developer experience improvement, but it ties into design insofar as
ensuring no platform-specific assumptions in the UI. For example, avoid hard-coding service URLs or
credentials in the frontend; instead use environment variables (which Docker containers can swap
out easily). From a design standpoint, this means any third-party integrations (like Google Fonts,
Spline embed links, etc.) should be easily configurable so that deploying to a different host doesn’t

break them. Ensure that building the Next.js app for static export or SSR works consistently (e.g. no
reliance on runtime that isn’t available). Using Tailwind and Next.js 15 means most styling is static
and can be containerized without issues. We should also provide documentation for how to run the
project in Docker (though not building the Dockerfile here, just note that the app listens on a port via
Next, uses npm run build && npm start which can be containerized). By keeping the design
and codebase platform-agnostic, you can deploy the same beautiful UI/UX to any host effortlessly.
This “design ops” consideration ensures your polished design isn’t locked to one environment – an
important practical improvement for a portfolio that might need to be moved or scaled in the future.
The above improvements focus on visual and UX enhancements while respecting best practices. Each
recommendation aims to reduce user effort, heighten aesthetic appeal, and maintain consistency – all
critical factors for an intuitive and memorable site (as emphasized by Krug ). Next, we translate some
of these recommendations into actual component design, focusing on the Project Card UI and how it can
be implemented with Tailwind CSS and React.

Upgraded Project Card Component (Tailwind + React)
Below is an example implementation of a redesigned ProjectCard component in Next.js 15 (React) using
Tailwind CSS. This card design follows the awwwards-inspired aesthetic: featuring a visual preview, a textual
overlay, and smooth interactive states. It is fully responsive and accessible, and includes a placeholder
skeleton logic for loading states.

// components/ProjectCard.jsx – A card showcasing a project with image, title,
etc.
import Imagefrom'next/image';
import { useState} from'react';
functionProjectCard({ project, onClick}) {
// Props: project { id, title, subtitle, imageSrc, altText }, onClick handler
for when card is clicked
const{ title, subtitle, imageSrc, altText} = project;
const[imageLoaded, setImageLoaded] = useState(false);
return(
<div
className="group relative rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-gray-800 shadow-lg

onClick={onClick}
onKeyDown={(e) => {if(e.key ==='Enter') onClick();}}

blurDataURL="/placeholder.png"

</div>
{/* Overlay with title and subtitle */}
<divclassName="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col justify-end
p-4 bg-gradient-to-t from-black/80 via-black/20 to-

{subtitle&&
<p className="mt-1 text-sm md:text-base text-gray-200 drop-shadow">

</p>
}
</div>
{/* Hover overlay (e.g., a "View More" indicator) */}
<divclassName="absolute inset-0 bg-black/10 opacity-
group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-
ease-in-out pointer-events-none"/>
</div>
);
}
export defaultProjectCard;
In this code:

The card is a focusable
to behave like a button (ensuring
keyboard accessibility). It calls onClick on Enter key for accessibility.
We wrap the image in a container that applies a slight blur and scale effect until the image loads, giving a
smooth image loading placeholder (using blurDataURL from Next Image for a low-res placeholder).
The Tailwind classes swap from blur-lg scale-105 to blur-0 scale-100 once loaded, and on
hover, we scale the image up slightly for a dynamic feel.
A translucent gradient overlay at the bottom provides a dark backdrop for text (ensuring readability over
any image) and is achieved with bg-gradient-to-t from-black/80 ... to-transparent. The
project title and subtitle are placed within, using Tailwind typography utilities (responsive text sizes so they
scale on md screens and above). We also add a slight text shadow (drop-shadow) to boost contrast
against the background.

Another overlay (
with a semi-transparent black) fades in on hover via group-
hover:opacity-100. This could be used to display an icon or simply to indicate interactivity. It’s marked
pointer-events-none so it doesn’t block clicks – it’s purely decorative.
The card has rounded corners and a subtle shadow (rounded-xl shadow-lg), aligning with modern
design trends (slight neumorphism without overdoing). The background (bg-gray-800) is a fallback solid
color that shows if the image hasn’t loaded yet, and also glimpses through on the edges around the image.
All hover and focus states are handled: e.g., group-hover:scale-105 on the image for a subtle zoom
effect; we could also add focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 on the card for an outline when
keyboard-focused for accessibility (not shown above but recommended).
The card is fully responsive: using relative units and letting the parent grid control its width. The text sizes
use Tailwind’s responsive modifiers so, for example, the title is text-xl on mobile and text-2xl on
medium screens, ensuring it scales nicely.
This component delivers a polished project card that matches an awwwards-level aesthetic: it’s visually
engaging (image with overlay, animation), clear in what it represents (title always visible with good
contrast), and provides feedback on interaction (hover effects). It also considers performance (blur-up
image) and accessibility (roles and keyboard interaction).

Responsive Behavior: The above card will size itself to its container. In a grid layout, you might use
something like:

// Example usage in a grid
<divclassName="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
{projects.map(prj => (
<ProjectCard key={prj.id} project={prj} onClick={()=> openModal(prj.id)} />
))}
</div>
This grid will show 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablets, 3 on desktop, with a consistent gap. The card’s internal
layout (text overlay) already adapts text size for md (≈768px) and up, but you can tweak breakpoints as
needed. On very large screens, you might increase the max-width for the grid container to avoid overly
stretched layouts (e.g., wrap the grid in max-w-6xl mx-auto to cap width).

Developer Handoff: Implementation Details (PRD)
To ensure a smooth developer handoff, below is a Product Requirement Document (PRD) style breakdown
of the components, naming conventions, props, states, and other considerations for implementing these
design upgrades in a React/Next.js 15 project with TailwindCSS:

Component Structure & Naming: We will create modular, clearly named components:
HeroSection: Full-page hero banner, containing the signature background (Spline or hero media)
and introductory text.
•
•
ProjectCard: Individual project preview card (as coded above).
ProjectList or ProjectsGrid: The section that maps through projects to display a responsive
grid of ProjectCards.
ProjectModal: The modal component that shows detailed info about a project.
Layout: A Next.js layout component that wraps pages, used to include persistent elements like the
HeroSection or a global header.
We use PascalCase for React components and camelCase for props and local variables. Classes and
IDs (if any) will be kebab-case (but we primarily use Tailwind utility classes rather than custom CSS
classes).
Props and Data Flow:
ProjectCard expects a project object prop with at least { id, title, subtitle,
imageSrc, altText }. We can extend this to include anything needed for a card display (like a
placeholder image or a category tag). It also takes an onClick prop to handle opening the modal.
This keeps it flexible: you can pass a function that sets some state or navigates to a route.
ProjectModal will likely accept either the full project data or an id which it uses to fetch data
(depending on how data is managed, e.g., could use Next.js dynamic routes or a context). Key props:
project (with detailed info), and possibly onClose callback.
If using Next.js App Router with dynamic segments, ProjectModal might be rendered via route
(for SEO). In that case, the ProjectList page would include something like:
{ modalProjectId && <ProjectModalproject={...} onClose={...} /> }
and use Next’s useRouter to manage modalProjectId from the URL (using shallow routing or
intercepting routes).
HeroSection may accept props like title, subtitle or perhaps children (if we allow
different text per page, but as per spec it’s global and persistent, so likely hardcoded content or site-
wide config).
We will ensure prop names are self-explanatory. For instance, use imageSrc instead of just src
in project data to clarify it’s an image URL.
State and Modal Logic:
For modals, we can use React state or context to track if a modal is open and which project is in view.
For example, clicking a ProjectCard sets currentProjectId state in the parent. This triggers
rendering of ProjectModal.
Alternatively, leverage Next.js routing: each project detail could be accessible at /projects/[id]
with a dedicated page that, if accessed normally, shows the details (for SEO), but if accessed via the
main page, is shown as an overlay. Next 13+ App Router offers intercepting routes for modals – we
can configure the routing so that when navigation happens client-side, the ProjectModal is
shown atop the current page.
• • • • • • • • • • • • • •
The modal component should handle its own close mechanism: perhaps by calling onClose prop
or using router.back() if using routes (so that the URL goes back to /#projects without the
modal).
Animation States: Use Tailwind utility classes or headless UI transitions to animate modal
appearance. For example, add a CSS transition for opacity/transform on the modal wrapper (e.g.
start with opacity-0 translate-y-4 and animate to opacity-100 translate-y-0). For
finer control, a library like Framer Motion or React Spring can provide springy animations (which
aligns with an interactive aesthetic). The ProjectCard hover animations we handled with CSS
(scale/blur).
Global State: If needed (for example, to prevent background scrolling when modal is open), we
might use a context or simply add a overflow-hidden class to <body> or a parent container
when any modal opens. This prevents double-scrolling issues.
Styling Conventions:
TailwindCSS will be the primary way to style, ensuring consistency and rapid UI changes. We’ll use
the design system enforced by Tailwind’s config (e.g., using the default color palette or extending it
with brand colors). Naming of classes is handled by Tailwind, but we will keep our JSX structured
semantically (header, main, section, etc., as appropriate).
We will use responsive modifiers (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) extensively to tailor the UI at different
breakpoints, as demonstrated in the ProjectCard code. The breakpoint definitions can be
Tailwind’s defaults (e.g., sm ~ 640px, md ~ 768px, etc.) which cover generic mobile, tablet, desktop
sizes. Additionally, we’ll test on actual devices (Chrome dev tools device emulation for iPhone/
Android sizes) to fine-tune any specific issues (like iOS Safari’s bottom bar overlap – usually handled
by safe-area CSS if needed).
Naming in Code: We maintain intuitive naming for state variables and handlers, e.g.,
isModalOpen, setModalOpen, selectedProject, etc., for clarity.
Assets & Image Handling:
All project screenshots will be managed via Next.js Image component for optimal performance. We
will store these images locally or on a CDN and provide multiple sizes if necessary. Using Image
with fill or fixed dimensions ensures the layout doesn’t shift. We will take advantage of
blurDataURL (as shown) to have a low-quality placeholder (LQIP) effect, which is visually
appealing and indicates loading.
In case an image fails to load or isn’t provided, we will have a placeholder image or color. For
example, a solid gray background with a default “image not available” icon centered (or simply keep
the card background as a neutral color with the title still visible).
The design includes skeleton loaders : for project cards, if content is loading, we can show a
<ProjectCardSkeleton /> – which could be a simplified version of the card with no image (just
a gray rectangle and some gray bars for text, using Tailwind’s animate-pulse). This prepares the
user for incoming content and keeps the layout stable. Similarly, when opening a modal, if the
project data is not immediately ready, show a ModalSkeleton (perhaps a blank image frame and
some loading lines) for a moment. These skeleton components won’t need many props (just maybe
a flag for “isDarkMode” if we want to adjust colors), and they use hardcoded placeholder elements.

Animations & Micro-Interactions:
Use CSS transitions (via Tailwind classes) for simple hovers and fades. For example, the card uses
transition-transform and transition-opacity utilities. We ensure the duration and
easing are consistent across components (e.g., 200–300ms ease-out for most hover effects, which
feels quick but smooth).
For more complex sequences (like a staggered reveal of cards on page load, or the hero text
animating in), consider using a small JavaScript utility or intersection observers. For instance, we can
add a Tailwind class that sets initial opacity 0 and translate down, and then add a class (via a React
effect or when element comes into viewport) to animate it in. There are also Tailwind plugins for
scroll reveal if needed.
If integrating GSAP for complex animations (since GSAP was referenced), we must ensure it doesn’t
bloat performance. GSAP could be used for the hero animation or for orchestrating staggered
animations of cards on page load. This would involve writing some JS in useEffect hooks to animate
refs. It’s an enhancement but not strictly required – CSS might suffice for most interactions. We’ll
choose the simplest tool for each job to keep maintenance easy.
Hero Section Implementation:
The HeroSection component will be placed in a Next.js layout so it’s present on all pages. This
component might contain the Spline embed. Typically, Spline provides an <iframe> or <canvas>
embed code. We should load this responsibly (maybe lazy-load it after initial paint to avoid blocking
LCP).
The hero’s content (like a headline, subheadline, maybe a call-to-action scroll prompt) should be in
HTML so it’s accessible and SEO-friendly (e.g., <h1> for the name or main tagline). Position this
content either centered or appropriately on the hero, and use Tailwind utilities to style (text color,
size, etc., plus maybe an animation class).
To avoid conflict with the Spline animation: if Spline is interactive (users can drag or click it), we must
ensure it doesn’t overlap essential navigation or content. Possibly set pointer-events: none on
the Spline canvas when a modal is open or when content covers it, so it doesn’t capture scroll or
clicks unexpectedly.
On smaller devices, the hero might be simplified – e.g., maybe show a static image fallback if the 3D
is too heavy, or hide some secondary text to fit the screen. This can be done with responsive
conditionals in JSX or CSS (e.g., a md:block hidden to only show an element on medium+
screens).
Link Logic & Routing (Modal-First):
Use Next.js routing such that clicking a card does
router.push('/projects/[id]', { shallow: true }) (shallow navigation) to update the
URL without full page load, and the page component detects this and shows ProjectModal. This
way, if someone directly visits /projects/[id], we can render the project details page (for SEO),
but in the context of the main page, it appears as a modal. Next.js 13+ can also handle modals via
route groups – we could set up a parallel route for modals that overlays on the main route. The exact
implementation can vary, but the key is no full page reload on opening a project. It should feel
• • • • • • • • • • •
instantaneous and reversible with the Back button (Back should simply close the modal and restore
the listing page state).
The “Open Site” button in the modal should use target="_blank" for external projects to respect
the idea of not navigating them away. If the project detail is internal (like case study page), then that
button could navigate internally – but given the prompt, likely it’s external project links. Clearly label
it (e.g., “ Open Live Site”) and perhaps use an external-link icon for clarity.
Also ensure that hitting the browser back button when a modal is open closes the modal (this will
happen naturally if we manage URL state correctly). Conversely, forward navigation (if user arrived
via a direct link to a project) should allow them to close to go back to the main list (so the routes
need to be well-linked).
Accessibility & Testing:
After implementing, test keyboard navigation: tab through the page – the focus order should
logically flow through the hero CTA (if any) to the project cards (each card gets focus outline). When a
card is focused and Enter is pressed, the modal opens and focus should move into the modal
(perhaps to the modal’s close button or the modal heading). We’ll utilize libraries or manage focus
manually using refs.
Test with a screen reader (like NVDA/VoiceOver) to ensure that the modal announcement is clear
(“Dialog: [Project Title], showing details...” which we can achieve by aria-labelledby linking the modal
title).
Check color contrast with tools or Tailwind’s documentation to ensure all text is AA compliant at
least.
If possible, test on actual mobile devices or emulators to verify the responsive UI and that
performance of animations is good (especially the Spline embed – ensure it’s not using too much
CPU on mobile; if it is, consider offering an option to pause it or a static fallback).
Docker & Deployment Considerations:
While we are not writing a Dockerfile here, ensure that the app can run on Node in a container
without issues. That means file paths and environment configs should be flexible. For instance, if
using any file system route reading (unlikely in frontend), account for container paths. Use
environment variables for any API endpoints or keys (Next.js supports this via process.env and can
be configured in Vercel, Railway easily).
The final app should build with next build and start with next start. All environment-specific
differences (development vs production) should be handled by Next.js config or environment
variables, so containerizing is straightforward.
We should also ensure that our design doesn’t rely on any functionality that would break in a
container (for example, if we used WebGL via Spline, ensure any required polyfills or permissions are
handled).
Provide documentation (in README) for steps to run the app, e.g., “npm install && npm run
build && npm run start” for production, which will be the same commands used in most
hosting platforms (including Docker).
For services like Vercel, since the site is Next.js, deployment is seamless – just ensure no build
warnings or errors from our changes (Tailwind should be configured properly with Next). For others
• • • • • • • • • • • • •
like Railway or Coolify that use Docker, confirm that the port is configurable (by default Next runs on
3000, which is fine) and no hard-coded domains (use relative URLs or environment base URLs).
