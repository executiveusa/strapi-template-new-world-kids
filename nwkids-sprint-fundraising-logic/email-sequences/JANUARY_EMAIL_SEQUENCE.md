**Subject:** 2026 is the year. Here's the plan.

Hi [First Name],

Happy New Year! 🎉

I'm not going to waste your time with empty resolutions. Here's exactly what's happening in 2026:

**January:** Complete infrastructure (greenhouse, kitchen, bathroom, fencing)
**February:** Launch Culture Shock pilot with 5 students from Seattle
**March-December:** Full programming for local youth in Paso de Guayabo

**Where we stand:**
- Raised in 2025: $[X]
- Still needed: $[X]
- Deadline: January 31, 2026

**29 days to finish what we started.**

This isn't a someday dream. It's a this-month reality. And you can be part of making it happen.

[HELP US FINISH STRONG]

Here's to a year of growth—in the garden and in life.

Hi [First Name],

I wanted you to see this:

[INSERT 2-3 PHOTOS OF CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS]

**This is what your support looks like.**

Right now, we're:
- [Specific activity 1 - e.g., "Laying the foundation for the greenhouse"]
- [Specific activity 2 - e.g., "Installing the security fence"]
- [Specific activity 3 - e.g., "Preparing beds for spring planting"]

**But we're not done.**

We've raised $[X] of our $25,000 goal. To complete everything before our February pilot launch, we need $[X] more in the next 25 days.

Can you help us cross the finish line?

[DONATE TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION]

Every dollar goes directly to materials and labor. No overhead. No salaries. Just impact.

## EMAIL 3: STUDENT SPOTLIGHT
**Send Date:** January 10
**Subject:** Meet the students who are waiting

---

Hi [First Name],

In 3 weeks, five young adults from Seattle will arrive in Puerto Vallarta.

They're leaving behind everything familiar to spend months learning skills most people never acquire:
- How to grow their own food
- How to build sustainable shelter
- How to manage water and energy systems
- How to speak a second language

**These aren't rich kids on a gap year.**

They're young people who've been stuck in "survival mode"—working dead-end jobs, unsure of their path, hungry for something meaningful.

The Culture Shock Program gives them that.

**But only if the infrastructure is ready.**

We need $[X] more by January 31 to complete construction. That's [X] days away.

[INVEST IN THEIR FUTURE]

When you give to New World Kids, you're not funding an abstract cause. You're funding real people with real dreams.

Thank you for seeing them.

— Bambu

## EMAIL 5: MLK DAY - SERVICE MESSAGE
**Send Date:** January 20 (MLK Day)
**Subject:** "Life's most persistent question..." — Dr. King

---

Hi [First Name],

*"Life's most persistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?"*
— Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Today, as we honor Dr. King's legacy, I'm thinking about that question.

New World Kids exists because a group of volunteers asked themselves: **What can we do for the next generation?**

The answer was simple but radical:
- Teach them to grow their own food
- Show them they can be self-sufficient
- Connect them to land, to community, to purpose

**We can't change the whole world. But we can change one young person's trajectory.**

Multiply that by 5 students this year. 20 next year. 100 in five years.

That's how movements start.

[JOIN THE MOVEMENT]

In service,
— Bambu

## EMAIL 6: FINAL WEEK LAUNCH
