**Number of donors:** [X]
**% of goal:** [X]%

To everyone who gave—thank you. You've invested in a living, breathing, producing food forest that teaches kids essential life skills.

## EMAIL 2: DECEMBER UPDATE - CORPORATE MATCHING
**Send Date:** December 8
**Subject:** Did you know your employer might DOUBLE your gift?

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Does your employer match charitable donations?

Many companies—especially tech companies in Seattle—will match your gift to New World Kids. Some even do **2:1 matching**.

**Here's how it works:**
1. You donate to New World Kids
2. You submit a matching request through your employer
3. Your company sends us a matching gift
4. Your $100 becomes $200 (or $300!)

**Companies that match:**
- Microsoft: 2:1 up to $15,000/employee
- Amazon: Up to $10,000/employee
- Google: $6,000/employee
- Boeing, Starbucks, T-Mobile, and hundreds more

**Already donated on Giving Tuesday?**
You can still submit for matching! Most programs accept requests for 30-90 days after the donation.

**Haven't donated yet?**
Now's the perfect time. Your gift goes further with matching.

## EMAIL 3: CHRISTMAS GIVING CAMPAIGN LAUNCH
**Send Date:** December 11
**Subject:** Give the gift of growth this Christmas 🎄

---

Hi [First Name],

This Christmas, give a gift that grows.

Instead of another sweater that gets returned, another gadget that gets forgotten—give something that lasts for generations.

**For $25:** Plant a fruit tree that will produce for 30+ years
**For $100:** Build a greenhouse section that protects seedlings year-round
**For $500:** Name a permanent part of the food forest

**Here's what makes this different:**

When you give to New World Kids, you're not buying a "thing." You're investing in a young person's ability to feed themselves, their family, and their community—forever.

That's a gift that keeps giving.

[GIVE THE GIFT OF GROWTH]

**Bonus:** All gifts are tax-deductible. Perfect timing for year-end giving.

Merry Christmas from Puerto Vallarta. 🌱
