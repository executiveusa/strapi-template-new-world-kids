#### Impact Stories

**Post 1: Before/After**
📸 *Side-by-side photo of land transformation*

"2020 → 2025.

The left photo is what we started with. Dead soil. Nothing growing. Everyone said it couldn't be done.

The right photo is today. 200+ species. Kids picking fruit. Life everywhere.

This is what's possible when you commit to regeneration.

We're raising $25,000 to build the infrastructure for our education programs. Link in bio to help us grow.

#### Education

**Post 7: Food Forest Fact**
📸 *Infographic or garden photo*

"Food Forest Fact:

A well-designed food forest can produce food for 100+ years with minimal maintenance once established.

Compare that to annual gardens that need replanting every season.

We're building systems that outlast us. That's the goal.

Learn more about our work. Link in bio.

**Post 8: Plant Feature**
📸 *Close-up of specific plant*

"Plant Spotlight: Moringa 🌿

Also called the 'miracle tree.'
- Leaves are 25% protein
- Contains all essential amino acids
- Grows fast (up to 15 feet in a year)
- Thrives in tropical climates

We have 12 moringa trees at Proyecto Indigo Azul. The kids harvest leaves weekly for smoothies and salads.

Growing food is medicine.

**Post 10: Honest Moment**
📸 *Candid photo or selfie*

"Real talk:

Fundraising is hard. Asking people for money is uncomfortable. Some days I wonder if any of this will work.

But then I see the kids in the garden. I see the soil that came back to life. I see the plants that are thriving.

And I remember why I'm doing this.

$[X] more to go. [X] days left.

**Post 1: Origin Story**

"Four years ago, I stood on 1.5 acres of dead land in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

The soil was depleted. Nothing would grow. The neighbors thought I was crazy.

I had a vision: What if we could transform this land into a food forest? What if we could teach kids to grow their own food? What if we could prove that regeneration is possible?

Today, that land has over 200 species of plants, trees, herbs, and flowers. Local kids come every week to learn. We're about to launch our first formal education program.

But we need help to finish.

We're raising $25,000 by January 31 to complete our infrastructure—greenhouses, kitchen, bathroom facilities—so we can host students full-time starting in February.

Will you help us finish what we started?

**Post 3: Impact Story**

"I want to tell you about Maria.*

She's 9 years old. She lives in Paso de Guayabo, the community where our food forest is located.

When we first started, Maria would peek through the fence, curious about what we were doing. Eventually, she asked if she could help.

Now, three years later, Maria can:
- Identify over 50 edible plants
- Start seeds and transplant seedlings
- Explain the basics of composting
- Speak simple phrases in English

She told me recently: 'I want to grow food like this at my house.'

That's the goal. Not just teaching kids in our garden—but giving them skills they take home and share with their families.

$25 plants a fruit tree that will produce for decades.
$100 funds a month of programming for a kid like Maria.
$500 builds a section of greenhouse.

*Name changed for privacy.

Help us reach more kids like Maria. 🌱"

### Professional Updates

**Post 1: Pilot Program Announcement**

"Excited to share a major milestone for New World Kids:

In February 2026, we're launching our first formal pilot program—the Culture Shock Program.

Five young adults from Seattle will travel to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico to spend months learning sustainable agriculture, second language acquisition, and essential life skills.

This isn't a vacation. It's an intensive, hands-on education program focused on the four basic human needs: food, water, energy, and shelter.

We've spent four years building the demonstration site. 200+ plant species. Thriving food forest. Community relationships established.

Now we're raising $25,000 to complete the infrastructure and make this launch possible.

If you know anyone at Microsoft, Amazon, or Google—many of these companies match charitable donations 2:1 or 1:1. A $1,000 gift can become $3,000.

I'd welcome any introductions or connections who might be interested in supporting youth education and sustainable development.

**Post 2: Corporate Matching CTA**

"PSA for my network in tech:

If you work at Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Boeing, Starbucks, or any company with a charitable matching program—you have money sitting on the table.

Here's how it works:
1. You donate to a qualified 501(c)(3)
2. You submit a matching request
3. Your company sends a matching gift
4. Your $100 becomes $200 (or $300 at Microsoft)

Most employees never use their match. That's literally free money for causes you care about.

I run a nonprofit called New World Kids that teaches youth sustainable agriculture and life skills in Mexico. We're a 501(c)(3) and we qualify for matching.

If you've been looking for a place to direct your year-end giving, I'd be honored if you'd consider us.

Happy to chat more if you have questions.

"🧵 Why I started New World Kids (thread):

1/ In 2020, I saw two problems colliding:

- Young people graduating with no practical life skills
- Land degradation destroying our ability to grow food

I thought: what if we could solve both at once?

2/ The idea: Build a demonstration food forest that teaches youth how to grow food, manage water, generate energy, and build shelter.

Not theory. Hands-on.

3/ Four years later: 1.5 acres transformed. 200+ species thriving. 15-20 local kids engaged weekly.

Proof of concept achieved.

4/ Now we're launching our first formal program—bringing young adults from Seattle to Puerto Vallarta to learn these skills.

But we need $25,000 to finish the infrastructure.

5/ If this resonates with you, I'd be grateful for your support:

Every dollar goes directly to the project. 100% volunteer-run.

Thank you. 🌱"
