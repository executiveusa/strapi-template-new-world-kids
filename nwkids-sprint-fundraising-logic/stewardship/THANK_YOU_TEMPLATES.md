# 🙏 THANK YOU & DONOR STEWARDSHIP TEMPLATES
## Making Donors Feel Valued and Keeping Them Engaged

## WHY STEWARDSHIP MATTERS

**The goal:** Turn one-time donors into repeat donors and advocates.

**The math:**
- Cost to acquire new donor: $1.00+ per dollar raised
- Cost to retain existing donor: $0.20 per dollar raised
- Repeat donors give 40% more than first-time donors
- A donor retained for 5+ years is worth 10x a one-time donor

**The rule:** Thank within 48 hours. Update monthly. Ask once per quarter.

[Name],

I just saw your donation come through. $[X].

You'll hear from me again with photos when construction is complete. You deserve to see what you helped build.

With deep gratitude,

Dear [Name],

I wanted to take a moment to write you personally.

Your gift of $[X] is extraordinary. In a world where people talk about making a difference, you actually did it.

The greenhouse we're building this month exists because of donors like you. The students arriving in February will have a safe, functional space because of you.

I don't take this lightly. You trusted me—a stranger, really—with your hard-earned money. That's not nothing.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'll send photos when it's done.

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### The 7:1 Rule
For every 1 ask, provide 7 touches of value (updates, thanks, stories, photos).

### The 48-Hour Rule
Thank every donor within 48 hours. No exceptions.

### The Specificity Rule
Don't say "your donation helps kids." Say "your $100 funded 4 fruit trees that will produce for 30 years."

### The Photo Rule
Every thank you should include a photo when possible. Visuals create connection.

### The Name Rule
Always use their first name. Never "Dear Donor" or "Dear Friend."

### The Honesty Rule
If something went wrong, tell them. Transparency builds trust.
