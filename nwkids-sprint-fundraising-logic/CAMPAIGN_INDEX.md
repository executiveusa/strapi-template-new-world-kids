## 🎉 SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

### If We Hit $25,000:
✅ Greenhouse completed
✅ Kitchen/bathroom facilities built
✅ Full year of rent secured
✅ Tools and materials purchased
✅ Culture Shock students arrive Feb 1 to full infrastructure
✅ Proof that grassroots fundraising works

### If We Fall Short:
We adjust. We prioritize. We make it work.
Every dollar raised still matters.
The program launches regardless—just at smaller scale.

- Progress over perfection
