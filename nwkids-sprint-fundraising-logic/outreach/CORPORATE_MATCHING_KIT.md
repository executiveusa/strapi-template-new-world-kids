# 💼 CORPORATE MATCHING OUTREACH KIT
## Templates for Engaging Tech Employee Donors

---

## OVERVIEW

### Why Corporate Matching Matters
- Microsoft: **2:1 match** up to $15,000/employee = $45,000 potential per person
- Amazon: Up to **$10,000 match** per employee
- Google: **$6,000 match** per employee
- Boeing, Starbucks, T-Mobile, Meta, Salesforce all have programs

### The Math
| Donor Gift | Microsoft Match (2:1) | Total Impact |
|------------|----------------------|--------------|
| $500       | $1,000               | $1,500       |
| $1,000     | $2,000               | $3,000       |
| $5,000     | $10,000              | $15,000      |
| $15,000    | $30,000              | $45,000      |

**One Microsoft employee giving $5,000 = $15,000 total impact**

## OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### TEMPLATE 1: LinkedIn Direct Message (Cold)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company] giving programs

---

Hi [Name],

I noticed you work at [Microsoft/Amazon/Google]. Quick question:

Have you used your charitable giving match this year?

I'm working with a nonprofit called New World Kids that teaches youth sustainable agriculture and life skills. We're a 501(c)(3), which means we qualify for corporate matching.

If you haven't used your match yet, a gift to us would be doubled (or tripled at Microsoft!).

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to hear about what we're doing? No pressure either way.

Thanks,
Bambu

### TEMPLATE 2: LinkedIn Direct Message (Warm - Mutual Connection)

**Subject:** [Mutual Friend] suggested I reach out

---

Hi [Name],

[Mutual Friend] mentioned you might be interested in what we're building at New World Kids.

We're a nonprofit teaching youth in Mexico and Seattle essential life skills—how to grow food, build sustainable systems, and become self-sufficient. I started this project 4 years ago and we're finally launching our pilot program in February.

I know [Company] has a matching gift program. If you're looking for a place to direct your charitable giving where it makes real impact, I'd love to tell you more.

15 minutes for coffee or a call?

— Bambu

### TEMPLATE 3: Email to Existing Contact

**Subject:** Your gift could be worth 3x (Microsoft matching)

---

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well!

I wanted to reach out because I know you work at [Microsoft/Amazon], and I have a time-sensitive opportunity.

New World Kids (the nonprofit I run) qualifies for corporate matching. That means if you give before [date], your company will match it—Microsoft does 2:1, which triples your impact.

**Here's what we're funding:**
- Greenhouse construction at our food forest in Mexico
- Kitchen and bathroom facilities for volunteers
- Tools and materials for youth education

We need to raise $25,000 by January 31 to complete infrastructure for our February pilot program launch.

A $1,000 gift from you becomes $3,000 with Microsoft matching. That's huge.

Would you consider it? I'm happy to jump on a call if you want more details.

[DONATION LINK]

Thank you for even considering this.

— Bambu

### TEMPLATE 4: Text Message (Close Contact)

---

Hey [Name]! Quick ask—have you used your [Microsoft/Amazon] charitable match this year?

I'm trying to raise $25K for New World Kids by Jan 31 and matching gifts would be huge. Your $500 becomes $1500 at Microsoft.

Can I send you more info?

---

### TEMPLATE 5: Follow-Up After Initial Contact

**Subject:** Following up on New World Kids

---

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my message from last week about New World Kids and corporate matching.

I know you're busy—just wanted to make sure this didn't get buried.

Quick summary:
- We're raising $25K for youth education infrastructure
- Your company matches donations (Microsoft = 2:1, Amazon = 1:1)
- Deadline: January 31, 2026

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. If the timing isn't right, no worries at all.

Thanks,
Bambu

## PHONE SCRIPT: CORPORATE MATCHING ASK

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi [Name], this is Bambu from New World Kids. Thanks for taking my call.

I wanted to reach out because I know you work at [Company], and I have an opportunity that could triple your charitable impact."

### The Hook (30 seconds)
"You've probably heard of corporate matching programs—[Company] will match donations you make to qualified nonprofits. New World Kids is a 501(c)(3), so we qualify.

Most people never use their match. It's basically free money for causes you care about."

### The Ask (60 seconds)
"Here's what we're doing: We're building a food forest and education center in Mexico that teaches young people how to grow their own food and become self-sufficient.

We need to raise $25,000 by January 31 to complete our infrastructure before our pilot program launches in February.

With Microsoft's 2:1 matching, a $1,000 gift from you becomes $3,000. That funds an entire greenhouse section.

Would you consider making a gift and submitting it for matching?"

### Handle Objections

**"I don't have that much to give."**
"Totally understand. Even $250 becomes $750 with matching. Every dollar helps, and it costs you nothing extra to submit for matching."

**"I already used my match this year."**
"That's great that you're already using it! Many companies reset their matching in January. Would you consider us for next year? I can follow up in early January."

**"I need to think about it."**
"Of course. Can I send you some information? And when would be a good time to follow up—next week?"

**"I'm not sure my company matches."**
"Would you be willing to check? Most large companies have matching programs. I can send you some resources on how to find out."

### Close
"Thank you so much for considering this. I'll send you the donation link and instructions for submitting the match. If you have any questions, please reach out anytime."
