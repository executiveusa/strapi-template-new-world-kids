## THE POWER OF PERSONAL ASKS

**Statistics:**
- Personal asks convert at 50%+ (vs. 1-3% for email)
- Average gift from personal ask is 3x email gift
- 85% of major gifts ($1,000+) come from personal relationships

**The Rule:** Your top 20 prospects should get personal outreach, not just emails.

## PHONE SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: Inner Circle - Close Friend/Family

**Opening:**
"Hey [Name], it's Bambu. Got a few minutes? I wanted to share something with you and ask for your help."

**The Story (2 minutes max):**
"You know I've been working on this project in Mexico for the past few years. We've built a food forest—over 200 species of plants now—and we're teaching local kids how to grow their own food.

Well, we're at a turning point. In February, we're launching our first formal program. Five young adults from Seattle are coming down to live on-site and learn sustainable living skills.

But I need to finish building the infrastructure first—greenhouses, kitchen, bathroom facilities—so it's actually livable."

**The Ask:**
"I'm trying to raise $25,000 by the end of January. I'm calling everyone I'm close to because this is the most important thing I've ever done, and I need help.

Would you be able to make a donation? Even $100 or $200 would make a real difference. And if you work at a company with matching, it could be doubled."

**Handle Response:**

*If Yes:*
"Thank you so much. That means the world to me. I'll send you the link right after this call. And I'll keep you posted on everything—you'll see exactly what your money builds."

*If Maybe/Need to Think:*
"Of course, take your time. Can I send you some information? And when would be a good time to follow up—later this week?"

*If No/Can't Right Now:*
"I totally understand. Money is tight for a lot of people. Would you be willing to share the campaign with anyone you know who might be interested? That would help a lot too."

**Close:**
"Thanks for listening, [Name]. This project means everything to me, and your support—whether financial or just moral—means a lot."

### SCRIPT 2: Professional Contact

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is Bambu [Last Name]. We [met at X / connected through Y / worked together at Z]. Do you have a few minutes?"

**Build Rapport (30 seconds):**
"How have you been? [Brief personal connection point]"

**Transition:**
"I wanted to reach out because I'm working on something I'm really passionate about, and I think you might find it interesting."

**The Pitch (90 seconds):**
"I run a nonprofit called New World Kids. We're building a food forest and education center in Mexico that teaches young people essential life skills—how to grow food, manage water, build sustainable systems.

We've been at it for four years, and we're finally launching our first formal program in February. Five young adults from Seattle are coming to live on-site and learn.

I'm in the middle of a fundraising campaign to finish the infrastructure—$25,000 by the end of January for greenhouses, facilities, and a year of rent."

**The Ask:**
"I'm reaching out to people I respect to see if they'd consider supporting this. Would you be open to making a contribution? Any amount helps, and if you're at a company with matching, it goes even further."

**Handle Response:**
[Same as above]

**Close:**
"Thank you for your time, [Name]. I really appreciate you listening. I'll send you some information either way—I'd love for you to follow along even if you can't give right now."

### SCRIPT 3: Corporate Employee (Matching Focus)

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is Bambu from New World Kids. I know you work at [Microsoft/Amazon/Google], and I have an opportunity that could triple your impact for a cause you care about."

**The Hook:**
"Do you know about your company's charitable matching program? Most people never use it—it's basically free money sitting on the table."

**The Pitch:**
"I run a nonprofit that teaches young people in Mexico and Seattle how to grow food and become self-sufficient. We're a 501(c)(3), so we qualify for matching.

I'm raising $25,000 to complete infrastructure for our pilot program launching in February. With [Company's] matching, a $500 gift from you becomes $1,500. A $1,000 gift becomes $3,000."

**The Ask:**
"Would you consider making a gift and submitting it for matching? It's one of the most efficient ways to support a cause—your donation works 2 or 3 times harder."

**Handle Objections:**
[See Corporate Matching Kit for detailed objection handling]

## IN-PERSON SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: Casual Conversation (Party, Event, Coffee)

**When They Ask "What Are You Up To?"**

"Actually, something really exciting. I run this nonprofit called New World Kids—we're building a food forest in Mexico that teaches kids how to grow their own food.

We just hit a major milestone—we're launching our first formal program in February with students from Seattle. But right now I'm in the middle of raising money to finish the construction.

[If they seem interested:] Yeah, we need about $25,000 by the end of January. I'm basically asking everyone I know. Would you want to hear more about it?"

**If They Say Yes:**
[Continue with abbreviated pitch, then ask directly]

"Would you consider making a donation? Even $50 or $100 helps. And if you work somewhere with matching, it goes further."

---

### SCRIPT 2: Scheduled Meeting (Coffee/Lunch)

**Opening (5 min):**
Casual catch-up, personal connection

**Transition:**
"So I wanted to tell you about what I'm working on and see if you might be interested in supporting it."

**The Story (5 min):**
Tell the full story—why you started, what you've built, where you're going. Use photos on your phone if possible.

**The Ask (2 min):**
"I'm raising $25,000 by January 31 to complete our infrastructure. I'm asking people I respect and trust to consider making a gift.

Based on what I've told you, would you be willing to make a contribution? I'm thinking about something in the range of $[X]—but whatever you can do would be meaningful."

**The Close:**
Give them time to respond. Be comfortable with silence. Don't fill the space with backpedaling.

### SCRIPT 3: Seattle Rotary Presentation (5 min version)

**Opening (30 sec):**
"Thank you for having me. My name is Bambu, and I'm the founder of New World Kids—a nonprofit teaching youth essential life skills through sustainable agriculture."

**The Problem (1 min):**
"Young people today graduate without knowing how to grow food, manage water, build shelter, or generate energy. They're dependent on systems they don't understand. And that's a problem—because when those systems fail, they have no backup."

**The Solution (2 min):**
"We're building a demonstration center in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where young adults learn these skills hands-on. Over four years, we've transformed 1.5 acres of dead soil into a thriving food forest with over 200 species.

Our Culture Shock Program brings young adults from Seattle to live on-site for months at a time, learning practical skills while serving the local community.

[Show 2-3 photos]

In February, we're launching our first formal pilot program with five students."

**The Ask (1 min):**
"We're raising $25,000 to complete our infrastructure by the end of January. I'm here today to ask for your support.

You can give directly, connect me with others who might be interested, or help spread the word.

Thank you for your time. I'll be here after the meeting if you want to talk more."

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "I can't afford it right now."
"I totally understand. Would you be able to share the campaign with anyone you know who might be interested? Or follow us on social media and help spread the word? That helps too."

### "I need to think about it."
"Of course. Can I follow up with you in a few days? And I'll send you some information to review in the meantime."

### "I don't know enough about the organization."
"That's fair. Can I send you some materials? We have a one-pager that explains everything. And I'm happy to answer any questions."

### "I already give to other causes."
"That's great—I'm glad you're supporting organizations you care about. If New World Kids resonates with you, I'd love to have you as a supporter. But no pressure if your giving budget is already committed."

### "Will my money actually make a difference?"
"100%. We're a small organization with zero paid staff. Every dollar goes directly to materials, construction, and program costs. I can show you exactly where the money goes."

### "How do I know this is legitimate?"
"Great question. We're fiscally sponsored by Humanitarian Social Innovations, a registered 501(c)(3). Tax ID is 46-4779591—you can look it up on GuideStar. And I'm happy to share photos, documents, anything you need."

## MINDSET NOTES

### Before Every Call
- You're not asking for a handout—you're offering an opportunity
- You're not begging—you're inviting participation
- Rejection isn't personal—it's about their circumstances
- Every "no" brings you closer to a "yes"

### The Ask is a Gift
You're giving people the chance to be part of something meaningful. Most people want to help—they just need to be asked.

### Authenticity > Polish
Don't memorize scripts word-for-word. Know the key points and speak naturally. Passion is more persuasive than perfection.

### Follow Through
If you say you'll send information, send it within the hour. If you say you'll follow up Tuesday, follow up Tuesday. Reliability builds trust.
