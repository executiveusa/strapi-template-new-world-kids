## 💡 OUR APPROACH

**Proof > Theory**
We build demonstration sites that show what's possible, then teach youth the skills to replicate it.

**Self-Sufficiency > Dependency**
Our goal is to give youth skills that last a lifetime—not temporary aid.

**Earn While You Learn**
Students receive stipends and career pathways after program completion.
