## EMAIL 1: PRE-GIVING TUESDAY (Send Monday Dec 1, evening)

**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "Tomorrow, your $25 becomes a fruit tree 🌳"
- B: "Bambu here - I need your help tomorrow"

**From:** Bambu via New World Kids <donate@nwkids.org>

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Tomorrow is Giving Tuesday, and I want to share something personal with you.

Three years ago, I stood on 1.5 acres of dead soil in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Nothing could grow there. The land was depleted, forgotten.

Today, that same land has over 200 species of plants, trees, and herbs. Kids from the neighborhood come to pick fruit and learn how to grow their own food. The soil is alive again.

**But here's what keeps me up at night:**

We've proven the concept works. The food forest is thriving. The kids are engaged. But we need $25,000 to build the infrastructure that takes this from "proof of concept" to "sustainable school."

We need:
- Greenhouses to protect our seedlings year-round
- A proper kitchen and bathroom for volunteers
- Fencing to keep the harvest safe
- A full year of rent secured ($400/month)

**Tomorrow, on Giving Tuesday, I'm asking for your help.**

Here's what your gift does:
- **$25** plants a fruit tree that feeds families for decades
- **$100** sponsors a section of our greenhouse
- **$500** names a permanent part of the food forest

Every donation through our fiscal sponsor (Humanitarian Social Innovations) is tax-deductible.

**I'll be online all day tomorrow sharing updates.** I want you to see where your money goes—not into overhead, but into soil, seeds, and young minds.

Will you join me?

## EMAIL 2: GIVING TUESDAY MORNING (Send Dec 3, 6:00 AM)

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "Today only: Transform dead soil into a food forest"
- B: "It's Giving Tuesday. Let's build something that lasts."

**Email Body:**

Good morning [First Name],

**It's Giving Tuesday.**

Today, people around the world give to causes that matter to them. I'm reaching out because I believe teaching kids to grow their own food—to be self-sufficient, connected to the earth, and capable of building their own futures—matters.

**Our goal today: $5,000**

That's enough to complete one full greenhouse and buy tools for our pilot program of 5 students.

Here's what we've already built (with almost no funding):
✅ 200+ plant species on previously dead land
✅ 15-20 local kids actively learning
✅ 3 years of community trust
✅ Proof that regenerative agriculture works

**What we need to scale:**
🏗️ Infrastructure: $20,000
🏠 Annual rent: $4,800
📊 Total: $25,000

Every dollar you give today goes directly to:
- Seeds and soil amendments
- Construction materials
- Tools for youth education
- Rent for the property

**No corporate overhead. No bloated salaries. Just growth.**

[DONATE $25 - PLANT A TREE]
[DONATE $100 - BUILD A GREENHOUSE SECTION]
[DONATE $500 - NAME THE FOOD FOREST]

I'll be posting updates all day on [Instagram/Facebook]. Come watch what we're building together.

Thank you for believing in a different kind of education.

## EMAIL 4: GIVING TUESDAY EVENING (Send Dec 3, 6:00 PM)

**Subject:** 5 hours left—we're [X%] there

---

**Email Body:**

[First Name],

The sun is setting in Puerto Vallarta, but Giving Tuesday isn't over yet.

**Current total: $[X]**
**Goal: $5,000**
**Time remaining: 5 hours**

I just walked through the food forest. The mango trees we planted 2 years ago are taller than me now. The kids who helped plant them? They come by every week to water and learn.

That's what your donation funds: **growth that compounds**.

Not a one-time handout. Not a temporary program. A living, producing, teaching food forest that will feed families for generations.

**We need $[remaining amount] by midnight.**

Can you help us get there?

[GIVE $25] [GIVE $50] [GIVE $100] [GIVE $500]

Thank you. Truly.

— Bambu

P.S. — If you've already given today, THANK YOU. If you can share this email with one friend, that helps too.
