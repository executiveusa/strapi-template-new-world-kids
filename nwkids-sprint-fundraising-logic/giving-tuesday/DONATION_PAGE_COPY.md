## THE STORY (Above the Fold)

**Three years ago, we started with dead soil.**

Nothing could grow on our 1.5 acres in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The land was depleted, forgotten, written off.

Today, that same land hosts **over 200 species of plants, trees, and herbs**. Local children come every week to learn how to grow food, care for the earth, and build skills that will serve them for life.

**We did this with almost no funding.** Just volunteers, community support, and a belief that young people deserve to learn how to be self-sufficient.

Now we need your help to take the next step.
