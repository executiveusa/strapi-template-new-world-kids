## DAY 1 - TUESDAY NOV 25
### Theme: "The Journey So Far"

**Instagram Post:**
```
📍 Puerto Vallarta, Mexico

3 years ago: Dead soil. Nothing could grow.
Today: 200+ species thriving. Kids learning. Families eating.

This is Proyecto Indigo Azul—our demonstration food forest teaching youth essential life skills.

Next week is #GivingTuesday. We need $25,000 to build greenhouses, secure our rent, and complete the infrastructure for our school.

Follow along this week as I share our story. 🌱

## DAY 2 - WEDNESDAY NOV 26
### Theme: "Why Food Security Matters"

**Instagram Post:**
```
🌱 What if every kid knew how to grow their own food?

That's not a dream—it's what we're building at @newworldkids.

Our curriculum teaches:
🍎 Food - How to grow nutrient-dense produce
💧 Water - Conservation and collection
⚡ Energy - Solar, biogas, sustainability
🏠 Shelter - Building with natural materials

These aren't "nice to have" skills. They're survival skills. Life skills.

6 days until #GivingTuesday.

2. FOOD - Garden photos
3. WATER - Water collection system

## DAY 3 - THURSDAY NOV 27 (THANKSGIVING)
### Theme: "Gratitude"

**Instagram Post:**
```
🧡 Today, I'm grateful for:

→ 200+ plant species that survived against all odds
→ 15-20 kids who show up every week to learn
→ Volunteers who believed before there was proof
→ A community in Paso de Guayabo that welcomed us
→ You—for following this journey

Happy Thanksgiving from Puerto Vallarta. 🙏

**Facebook Post (longer):**
```
Thanksgiving in Puerto Vallarta looks a little different.

No turkey (we're mostly plant-based here). No extended family gathering. But plenty of gratitude.

I'm grateful for:

🌱 The land that's healing after we restored it from complete degradation
👧🏽👦🏻 The neighborhood kids who come by to pick fruit and ask questions
🤝 The volunteers from Seattle, Phoenix, and Mexico City who made this real
💚 Every person who's donated their time, money, or expertise

Three years ago, I started Proyecto Indigo Azul with a vision: teach youth essential life skills through hands-on agriculture. Today, we have proof it works.

Next week, on Giving Tuesday, we're asking for help to take the next step.

Thank you for being part of this story.

Happy Thanksgiving. 🧡

## DAY 4 - FRIDAY NOV 28 (BLACK FRIDAY)
### Theme: "Anti-Black Friday"

**Instagram Post:**
```
🖤 ALTERNATIVE BLACK FRIDAY 🖤

What if instead of buying more stuff...
you invested in something that grows?

For the price of a discounted gadget:
💚 $25 plants a fruit tree
💚 $50 buys seeds for a growing season
💚 $100 sponsors a greenhouse section

No shipping fees. No buyer's remorse.
Just real impact for real kids.

Link in bio. 4 days until #GivingTuesday.

## DAY 5 - SATURDAY NOV 29
### Theme: "Meet the Kids"

**Instagram Post:**
```
📸 These are some of the kids from Paso de Guayabo who help us in the food forest.

They started as curious neighbors. Now they:
→ Know which plants are ready to harvest
→ Can identify 20+ species by leaf shape
→ Help with watering and composting
→ Are learning English (and teaching me Spanish)

This is what education should look like.

Not sitting in rows memorizing facts.
Hands in the soil. Learning by doing.

3 days until #GivingTuesday.

Youth Education That Actually Works

After 3 years of building a demonstration food forest in Puerto Vallarta, I've learned something:

Kids don't need more screen time. They need soil time.

Our program teaches essential life skills through hands-on agriculture:
• Growing food
• Water conservation
• Sustainable energy
• Natural building

We have 15-20 local kids actively engaged. Five pilot students ready for our Culture Shock program. And a waiting list.

What we don't have: the infrastructure funding to scale.

This Tuesday (Dec 3) is Giving Tuesday. We're raising $25,000 to complete our learning center.

If you know anyone in the Seattle tech community interested in supporting youth education and sustainable agriculture, I'd appreciate an introduction.

## DAY 6 - SUNDAY NOV 30
### Theme: "Before & After"

**Instagram Carousel (5-7 images):**
```
Slide 1: "3 Years of Transformation" (title)
Slide 2: Before photo - barren land (2020)
Slide 3: First planting (2021)
Slide 4: Growing (2022)
Slide 5: Thriving (2023)
Slide 6: Today (2025)
Slide 7: "Help us build what's next" + donation link

Caption:
2020: Dead soil. Nothing growing.
2025: 200+ species. Kids learning. Families fed.

This transformation didn't happen with funding.
It happened with faith, sweat, and community.

But to take the next step—building proper infrastructure—we need your help.

2 days until #GivingTuesday.

1/ Tomorrow is #GivingTuesday and I need your help.

For 3 years, I've been building a food forest in Mexico that teaches kids essential life skills.

200+ plant species. 15-20 kids engaged. Zero major funding.

Here's the thread on why this matters: 🧵

2/ We teach the 4 things every human needs:
- Food (how to grow it)
- Water (how to conserve it)
- Energy (how to generate it)
- Shelter (how to build it)

These skills aren't taught in schools. But they should be.

3/ Our goal: $25,000 to complete infrastructure
- Greenhouses
- Kitchen & bathroom for volunteers
- Fencing
- Year of rent ($400/month)

Tomorrow's #GivingTuesday target: $5,000

4/ Every donation is tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor @HSInnovations (501c3).

$25 plants a tree.
$100 sponsors a greenhouse section.
$500 names the food forest.

5/ Tomorrow I'll be sharing updates all day.

Follow along. Share this thread.
